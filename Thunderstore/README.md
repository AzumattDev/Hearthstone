# Description

## Adds an item to the game that allows you to return to your bed or the default start temple if no bed is found. Configurable recipe.

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`


---

Basically, I had gotten permissions a long time ago (3 years ago) to make DetalHes's mod without JÃ¶tunn. Since, he has
made his
without it, but hasn't maintained it. So, I was asked to revive my changes. To make it better, I basically rewrote how I
was doing the mod to start with to move over to the internal managers. Mine had the additional feature of making admins
also be restricted by or bypassing the teleport restrictions.

### Default Recipe

Coins: 30

Resin: 10

BoneFragments: 10

### Localization

Hearthstone supports localization. This means that you can create language files for different languages. For example,
to add a Korean translation to this mod, a user could create a `Hearthstone.Korean.yml` file inside the config
folder and add Korean translations there. By default, the mod supports English, German, French, Russian and Spanish.

Code Repo is [here](https://github.com/AzumattDev/Hearthstone) with all changes since 3 years ago.
